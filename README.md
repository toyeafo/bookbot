# BookBot

## Overview

**BookBot** is a simple Python program designed to analyze the content of a text file (e.g., a book) and generate a report. The program counts the total number of words and the frequency of each letter in the text, providing a basic textual analysis. BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## Features

- **Word Count**: Counts the total number of words in the provided text file.
- **Letter Frequency**: Analyzes the text and counts the frequency of each letter (case-insensitive).
- **Report Generation**: Outputs a simple report summarizing the word count and letter frequencies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bookbot.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd bookbot
    ```

3. Ensure you have Python installed and ready to use.

## Usage

1. Place the text file you want to analyze (e.g., `frankenstein.txt`) in the appropriate directory.
2. Update the `book_path` variable in `main.py` to point to your text file.
3. Run the program:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. The program will output a report to the console, including the total word count and the frequency of each letter.

## Project Structure

- **`main.py`**: The main script that runs the text analysis and generates the report.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories for Git to ignore.
- **`README.md`**: Provides information about the project (this file).
